	<h1>About Dior</h1>
	<p>
		Dior Sovoa is a celebrity hairstylist and image consultant new to the New York scene. However, with almost 20 years of experience he is by no means new to the industry. Originally hailing from our country's capitol, Washington D.C., Dior grew up watching his mother style hair. "I watched her", he says, "and it just caught on, I was meant to do hair." Dior went on to hone his skills, learning from some of the industry's best. The Aveda Cosmetology School and Ted Gibson among them. When Dior made the decision to pursue the swift paced world of celebrity and entertainment hair, his move to New York was imminent.

		Still fresh on the scene Dior has already established himself as a force to be reckoned with. His work can currently be seen on several of Vh1's hit series including Love and Hip Hop NY and Black Ink Crew. His work has been published in esteemed publications such as Essence, Vogue, The Source, Seventeen, and Vibe Magazine to name a few. His work can also be seen in national and international ad campaigns, film, music, and fashion.

		When he isn't styling the casts of Love & Hip Hop NY and Black Ink Crew you can find Dior sinking his shears into the tresses of clients such as actress and model Liris Cross best known for her role in the film, "Best Man", Angie Martinez, actress, rapper and well known radio personality, and up and coming artist Sky Heavens who has toured with the likes of Nicki Minaj and Eminem.

		Dior is building a name for himself that's synonymous with passion and effortless finesse. He is a master of his craft. As Dior continues to grow his brand he looks to the future with plans to one day (soon) develop a line of hair care products and tools.

		Father of two, all his hard work is for none other than his children. He hopes to keep this family tradition by passing his passion and wealth of knowledge along to his children. Keep your ends trimmed and an ear to the wall, well be seeing a lot more from Dior.
